Kodluyoruz OOP Homework - track information about animals in a zoo.

### Animals:
It is characterized by species in groups such as 
- Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
- Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
- rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
<br>

Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings.
species name, weight, age, etc.
<br>
The system should also be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage()
System should be able to calculate Feed timings => getFeedSchedule()
The logic by which the system performs these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm is different for horses and will be different for tigers.
